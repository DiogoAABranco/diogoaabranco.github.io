## Reliable Change Index (RCI)

The **Reliable Change Index (RCI)** is a statistical method used to determine whether the change in a patient’s score on a psychological measure over time is statistically significant and not due to measurement error. It helps to distinguish **meaningful clinical improvement** from random fluctuations or measurement noise.

RCI is calculated by comparing the difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment scores against the standard error of the difference. If the observed change exceeds a critical threshold (usually ±1.96 times the standard error), it is considered a **reliable change**.

This approach is valuable in psychotherapy research to assess whether individual patients experience real and clinically significant progress, rather than just statistical group effects.
