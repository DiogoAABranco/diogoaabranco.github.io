I am a Ph.D. candidate in Informatics Engineering at the [University of Madeira](https://www.uma.pt/). My academic background is rooted in Clinical Psychology, with both bachelor's and master's degrees in the field.

As a multidisciplinary researcher, I work at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and technology. My doctoral research, conducted within the [NeuroRehabLab](https://neurorehablab.arditi.pt/), focuses on Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) for motor and mental rehabilitation. I aim to develop innovative, tech-driven solutions that enhance the quality of life for individuals with special needs.

Currently, I’m building Virtual Reality frameworks that leverage affective computing, computer vision, and emotion recognition to create smarter tools for researchers and clinicians. Alongside my research, I also supervise several master’s students in Computer Science.
